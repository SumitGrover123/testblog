<h2 title="Welcome">Welcome, reader!</h2>
<h5 title="author">by: Fawkes Phoenix</h5>
<h5 title="publishing date">last updated: 2017-April-07, 19:20 IST</h5>
<hr />

<p>Hello, reader, I am Fawkes Phoenix, and I muse over things!</p>
<p>Obviously, Fawkes Phoenix is a made-up name - I mean, I wish my parents had given me such an awesome name, but well, we can't have everything in life now, can we?</p>
<p>I have decided to start my very own blog to better organize my internal brooding, and give myself an outlet. Internet is the best I could come up with.</p>
<p>This blog will be an amalgamation of all that comes from my internal analyzing. Any and all great epiphanies I encounter will be posted here. Don't worry, valid sources will be provided wherever needed - for proper citations are the backbone of internet knowledge.</p>
<p>In short, this is the page where I'm going to put out what goes on in my mind over anything and everything.</p>
<p>The topics maybe as varied as relating to -</p>
<p>1. <a href="politics.html">Politics, Administration and Military</a> - Attempts will be made to cover almost all the world's countries and their political, administrative and military issues plaguing them. International Geo-politics will be a most favorite focus. International institutions like United Nations and other political or other types of intra-national cooperation unions or associations of the world will be discussed here as well.</p>
<p>2. <a href="economics.html">Finance, Economics, Marketing, Business and Entrepreneurship</a> - The world's major financial and economic institutions, including IMF, World Bank, BIS, and even various ratings agencies will be discussed here. An attempt will be made to provide informed opinion about the mentioned institutions and their inner and apparent workings. Digital forms of wealth, especially crypto-currencies like bitcoin, will also be discussed here.</p>
<p>3. <a href="social.html">Social, Culture, Religion and Faith</a> - Whatever happens in the world, happens for the people, by the people. Man is a social animal, and not only does man makes the society, but it's also the society that makes a man who he is, and hence, any and all socio-cultural topics will be discussed here. The topic of religion, being controversial, will still be covered with full professionalism, although, criticism will be made where criticism is the only logical response possible. Extremism will not be tolerated, although appeasement at the risk of self-harm under the guise of secularism will also be frowned upon. Helping the needy, irrespective of their "social-construct" affiliations to religion or caste or any other group, will be given major focus here.</p>
<p>4. <a href="history.html">History</a> - It is often said, "those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it", and hence, this topic will attempt to make sure the reader is taught some well-needed lessons from history. It is expected that the reader will learn from it, so as to not have to repeat it. A timeline system will be add in the future as soon as I learn how to.</p>
<p>5. <a href="geography.html">Geography</a> - This segment will cover the study and research of the physical part of our planet. The location of places and their significance will be the main focus. This segment will also discuss geology of the areas - minerals found their and the mining processes adopted to make full use of the resources.<p>
<p>6. <a href="environment.html">Environment, Natural Conservation, Climate Change</a> - Climate change is a pressing matter, and I officially believe humans are bringing great harm to the planet's natural resources. This topic will revolve around the wrongdoings of man against nature, and suggestions will be offered wherever deemed necessary.</p>
<p>7. <a href="health.html">Health</a> - Latest, mind-boggling, life-saving medical research will be covered here. It is my personal belief that healthcare is every human being's fundamental right, and if any government has to be called credible and people-friendly then they must provide free, high-quality healthcare to its citizens. Alternative medicine will only be suggested when properly authorized citations are available in favor.</p>
<p>8. <a href="education.html">Education</a> - Children, our society's most precious group of people, are our future. Education shapes the society's children, and any competitive government will make sure that most of their attention is utilized on providing future-oriented, all-encompassing education to its children. This topic will try to cover the short-comings of our current education system, while novel attempts at improving the situation will be highlighted upon.</p>
<p>9. <a href="sci&tech.html">Science and Technology</a> - Scientific advancements take the world forward and help the society in ways too expansive to discuss here in this meagre introduction. Anything and everything science related will be discussed here, the focus being on developments that benefit humankind.</p>
<p>10. <a href="electronics.html">Electronics, Gadgets, Digital/Virtual world</a> - Ever improving technological advancements mark a society's forward-looking ideology by promising the best of society to its people. This topic will cover what the latest inventions are, and how they'll be helpful to the people. "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" - so, we will also be discussing video-games here.</p>
<p>11. <a href="sports.html">Sports, Recreational Activities</a> - Digital recreation like video-games offer only one part of an over-all development of any child/person. Physical activities, especially sports, but also including painting, performance arts, photography, or any other creative endeavor, offer a bigger portion of what can be construed as a full workout.</p>
<p>12. <a href="newsent.html">News, Entertainment, Social Media and Blogging</a> - Latest developments in the world, including the world of movies, television, web-series, as well as, social media trends and topics taking the blogging world by the storm will be discussed here.</p>
<p>13. <a href="tourism.html">Tourism</a> - Our world is a very beautiful place, and every human alive deserves a chance to explore it all. This topic will try to bring the world to your eyes, from the comfort of your screen.</p>
<p>14. <a href="selfmot.html">Self Improvement and Motivation</a> - Even the strongest people feel weak sometimes. This topic will attempt to give them the sorely needed boost of confidence. If I can motivate just one person, I'll feel like my hard work has paid off.</p>
<p>Every post will include an easily legible structure, with proper time stamps, even on edits where ever necessary.</p>
<p>It is expected that the list of topics will increase as time goes by. Please be patient with me, as this literally, is a one-man operation, without any pre-written material, although a lot of it is copypasted from free-to-reproduce sources.</p>

<p>regards, <br>
